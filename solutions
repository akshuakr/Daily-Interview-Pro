Q1.

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

You are given an array of integers. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. The array may contain duplicate entries.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should return 2 because it is the smallest positive integer that doesn't exist in the array.

Ans.

n=eval(input('enter the list: '))
b=sorted(n)
e=list(dict.fromkeys(b))
z=list(filter(lambda x: x >=0, e))
d=b[-1]
c=list(range(1,d+1))
for i in range(0,d+1):
    if z[i]!=c[i]:
        break
print(c[i])
